You can manage your taxes online, safely, and easily with an H&R Block account. After you log in, you can:

Send in your federal and state tax returns

Get to your tax papers and W-2 forms

Upload documents that back up your claim

Save returns that aren't finished and finish them later

Get help from tax professionals

Get alerts and keep track of your refund status

It's all in one location, so you can easily get to it during tax season or whenever you need it.

Things You Should Have Ready Before You Sign In
You will need the following to properly log in to your H&R Block account:

A username or email address that is registered

The password for your account

A reliable internet connection

Access to your phone or email for verification (if you use two-factor authentication)

A computer, tablet, or smartphone that is safe

If you're new, you'll need to make an account before you can sign in. This means giving basic information, checking your email, and making a strong password.

How to Sign In Step by Step
Step 1: Go to the official H&R Block website or app.
To get started, open your browser and go to the official H&R Block site. You can get the H&R Block app from your app store if you want to use a smartphone or tablet.

Step 2: Click the "Sign In" button
Look for the "Sign In" button on the homepage. It is normally in the top right corner.

Step 3: Type in your login information
You will be taken to a login screen where you can enter your email address or username and then your password. Watch out for capital letters and unique characters.

Step 4: Finish Verification (If Needed)
If you have two-factor authentication turned on, you'll get a code by text or email that can only be used once. When asked, type in this code to prove who you are.

Step 5: Go to your account dashboard
When you sign in successfully, you'll see your account dashboard. You can start a new tax return, pick up where you left off on a saved return, look at past filings, and get further help here.

How to Set Up an H&R Block Account
If you don't have an account yet, do these things:

Press the "Sign In" button

Choose "Create Account" or "Register"

Type in your name, email address, and a password.

Pick security questions and type in your responses.

To confirm your email, click the link that was delivered to your inbox.

You can log in at any moment once you register with your updated information.

Fixing Common Sign-In Issues
Forgotten Password:
On the login screen, click the link that says "Forgot Password?" Use your registered email to follow the steps to change your password.

Forgot your username?
To get your account back, click "Forgot Username?" and enter your email address.

If you can't get the verification code, check your garbage or spam folder. If you're using an app, make sure your phone is working or connected to the internet.

Account Locked: If you try to log in too many times and fail, your account may be temporarily locked. Try again in a few minutes or change your password.

If the site isn't loading properly, try clearing your browser's cache, using a newer browser, or switching to a different device or browser.

How to Keep Your Account Safe
It's crucial to take security seriously because your H&R Block account has private financial information.

Make sure your password is strong and unique.

Don't use the same password for more than one account.

Turn on two-factor authentication

Don't log in on public Wi-Fi

After utilizing shared devices, always sign off.

Change your password often.

These methods help keep your personal and financial information safe from people who shouldn't have it.
